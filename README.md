# This is a Data Science Internship I participate in with CODSOFT

In this internship project I develop model for classifyinh iris flower, from its sepal, it can tell if the flower is setosa, versicolor or virginica  

<a href> Click here to see my YouTube video for a stepwise approach I took to solve this problem

There are three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. 

My objective was to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements.
