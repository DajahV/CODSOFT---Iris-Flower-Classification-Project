# This is an Internship Project I Participate in from CODESOFT

This is an internship project I was assigned to by CODESOFT company.

There are three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. 

My objective was to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements.
